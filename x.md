Absolutely! Here's the same explanation in clean, **report-friendly bullet points format** instead of tables:

### ‚úÖ **Design Principles Implemented in the Project**

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
  - Each class in the project is focused on a single responsibility.
  - Examples:
    - `BookingService` handles business logic related to booking.
    - `BookingController` manages HTTP requests and user interaction.
    - `ReservationRepository` is responsible for MongoDB operations.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
  - Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
  - Example:
    - You can add new types of tables (`ExtraLargeTable`, `TenSeaterTable`, etc.) without changing the existing logic in `TableFactory`.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
  - Subclasses can be used wherever their parent classes are used without affecting the program's correctness.
  - Example:
    - All `Table` subclasses (`SmallTable`, `MediumTable`, etc.) can be used interchangeably in reservation logic.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
  - Interfaces are kept small and relevant to specific needs.
  - Example:
    - The `Command` interface defines only what is necessary for command actions, avoiding bloated interfaces.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
  - High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules directly; both depend on abstractions.
  - Example:
    - `BookingService` depends on the `ReservationRepository` interface, not the MongoDB implementation, allowing for easier testing and flexibility.

### ‚ùì **Do You Need Chain of Responsibility?**

- Not strictly required for the current version of your project.
- It could be useful in the future for:
  - Booking validation pipelines (e.g., date availability, duration limits).
  - Applying discounts or booking conditions in layers.
- Recommended if you want to modularize rules and validations in a flexible, extendable way.

### üß† **GRASP Principles Reflected in the Project**

- **Controller**
  - The `BookingController` acts as the controller handling user actions and HTTP endpoints.

- **Creator**
  - `BookingService` creates reservation instances and assigns them as needed.

- **Information Expert**
  - Classes like `TableFactory` and `Reservation` contain and operate on their own data, making them experts of their own state.

- **Low Coupling**
  - Each layer (controller, service, model, repository) interacts through well-defined interfaces, minimizing interdependencies.

- **High Cohesion**
  - Each class or component is tightly focused on one task (e.g., table creation, reservation processing), improving maintainability.
